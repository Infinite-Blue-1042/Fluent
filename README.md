# Fluent
The official coding language to create apps in rOS.

## Commands
### Window
The window command does work with windows. Here are some examples.
```
window create app
window rename app Resist App
window size app 800 600
window run app
```
App is the name of our variable. You could easily specify ```window create screen``` and it would work just fine. You can have multiple windows this way.
